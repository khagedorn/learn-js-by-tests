JavaScriptByTests
=================

This is an environment for a JavaScript tutorial. It combines
explanatory text - given in Markdown syntax - with a code
editor on the same page that can run JavaScript code interactively.
By making given unit tests green the user gets instant feedback if
his code works or not.

Should run in any good browser by opening index.html
